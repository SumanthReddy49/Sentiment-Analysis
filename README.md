Sentiment Analysis

Problem Statement:

Classifying the polarity of the given text, Whether the
expressed text is positive or negative.

How-it-works:

It takes reviews as an input applies sentiment analysis and returns the positive
response and negative response percentages. (This application processes only
textual data).

Use of this application:

The owner of a particular product or let’s say any organization if want to know about
how it has reached the public then they can use this application and get the
feedback in the real-time and make necessary changes immediately so as to
minimize the damage if there is any negative talk.

Phase-1(Getting the test set):

● Using python libraries writing python code to get the reviews based on a
particular keyword.

● By the end of this phase, we will be having the reviews on which we are
applying sentiment analysis.

Phase-2 (Pre-processing the training set):

● Once you get the training set you iterate through the reviews and tokenize
them and remove the all unnecessary things, basically, we parse the reviews.

● We use NLTK (natural language toolkit) in doing so.

Phase-3 (Classifying the data):

● Classify the data we got after phase 3 using inbuilt libraries.

Phase-4(Testing):

● Test it on the reviews we get in phase1.
Other Requirements:

● Python Platform(Anaconda, Spyder)

● NLTK package.
